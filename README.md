# CourtCounter
This is my Android Court Counter mobile applicattion.

This is the only android app that I made using JAVA, and not using HTML5, CSS and jQuery. Unlike my other projects.

This app is made for keeping score for basketball teams, the app provides 3 points, 2 points, 1 point scores.

The user only presses one of the buttons mentioned, the score updates and at the same time the user can reset the scores.
